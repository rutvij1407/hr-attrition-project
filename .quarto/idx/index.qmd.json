The study addresses three primary research questions using a multi-method approach including decision trees, cross-validated random forests, logistic regression with interaction terms, LASSO regularization, gradient boosting machines, and stratified departmental analysis.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Work-Life Imbalance:** OverTime emerges as the dominant predictor of attrition across all modeling approaches, with employees working overtime showing approximately 2.9× higher attrition rates (30.5% vs 10.4%). Decision tree analysis identifies distinct high-risk profiles combining overtime work with low tenure.\n\n2.  **Career Stagnation & Compensation:** Years since last promotion demonstrates a compounding effect on attrition risk, with the 4-year mark representing a critical threshold where risk accelerates substantially. LASSO variable selection confirms that career progression indicators outweigh pure compensation metrics.\n\n3.  **Department-Stratified Satisfaction:** The predictive power of satisfaction variables varies significantly across departments. R&D shows strong relationships between all three satisfaction types and retention, while Sales exhibits selective effects, and HR's small sample size limits reliable inference.\n\n```{r executive-summary-table}\n#| label: executive-summary-table\n\nn_employees <- nrow(hr_data)\nattrition_rate <- mean(hr_data$Attrition_Binary) * 100\nn_attrition <- sum(hr_data$Attrition_Binary)\n\novertime_attrition <- hr_data %>%\n  filter(OverTime == \"Yes\") %>%\n  summarise(rate = mean(Attrition_Binary) * 100) %>%\n  pull(rate)\n\nno_overtime_attrition <- hr_data %>%\n  filter(OverTime == \"No\") %>%\n  summarise(rate = mean(Attrition_Binary) * 100) %>%\n  pull(rate)\n\nattrition_table <- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\n    \"Total Employees Analyzed\",\n    \"Overall Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Total Employees Who Left\",\n    \"Overtime Workers Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Non-Overtime Workers Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Relative Risk (Overtime vs Non-Overtime)\"\n  ),\n  Value = c(\n    format(n_employees, big.mark = \",\"),\n    percent(attrition_rate/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    format(n_attrition, big.mark = \",\"),\n    percent(overtime_attrition/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    percent(no_overtime_attrition/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    paste0(round(overtime_attrition/no_overtime_attrition, 1), \"x\")\n  )\n)\n\nknitr::kable(\n  attrition_table,\n  col.names = c(\"Summary Metric\", \"Value\"),\n  align = c(\"l\", \"c\"),\n  caption = \"Table 1: Executive Summary Statistics\"\n) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Introduction\n\nEmployee turnover represents one of the most significant challenges facing modern organizations. Industry research estimates that replacing an employee costs between 50% and 200% of their annual salary when accounting for recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, training, and lost productivity during the transition period (Society for Human Resource Management, 2022). For a mid-level employee earning $65,000 annually, this translates to replacement costs of $32,500 to $130,000 per departure. Understanding the factors that drive employees to leave enables targeted retention strategies before valuable talent departs.\n\nThis analysis leverages the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, a realistic simulated dataset designed by IBM data scientists specifically for predictive HR analytics research and education. The dataset contains `r nrow(hr_data)` employee records with `r ncol(hr_data)` attributes spanning demographics, job characteristics, satisfaction metrics, and work-life balance indicators.\n\n## Dataset Selection and Justification\n\n**Dataset Source:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset\n**Availability:** Publicly available via data.world repositories (Aizemberg, 2017)\n**Sample Size:** `r format(nrow(hr_data), big.mark = \",\")` employees\n**Variables:** `r ncol(hr_data)` employee attributes\n**Response Variable:** Binary attrition indicator (Yes/No)\n\n**Rationale for Dataset Selection:**\n\nThe selection of this dataset was driven by several methodological and practical considerations that align with the objectives of this statistical learning project:\n\n1.  **Realistic Structure:** While this is a simulated dataset created by IBM data scientists for educational purposes, it accurately mirrors the structure, variable types, and statistical relationships found in actual enterprise HR data. The variables include standard HR metrics (demographics, job characteristics, satisfaction scores, performance ratings) that organizations routinely collect through Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS).\n\n2.  **Appropriate Class Imbalance:** The `r round(attrition_rate, 1)`% attrition rate reflects realistic conditions where employee departure is a minority event, requiring proper handling techniques (weighted learning, threshold optimization, stratified sampling) that generalize to production environments.\n\n3.  **Multiple Variable Types:** The dataset includes categorical variables (Department, JobRole, MaritalStatus), ordinal variables (satisfaction scores 1-4), and continuous variables (Age, MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany), enabling demonstration of diverse modeling techniques.\n\n4.  **No Proprietary Restrictions:** Unlike actual company data which faces confidentiality and privacy restrictions, this dataset can be freely analyzed and published, enabling transparent methodology demonstration.\n\n5.  **Established Benchmark:** This dataset is widely used in HR analytics research and machine learning competitions, providing established baselines for model performance comparison.\n\n**Dataset Limitations Acknowledged:** As a simulated dataset, certain patterns may be artificially clean (no missing values, clear variable definitions). Real-world data would require additional preprocessing. However, the analytical methodologies demonstrated transfer directly to production environments.\n\n## Research Questions\n\nThree primary research questions drove the analysis for this project:\n\n1.  **Work-Life Imbalance & Attrition Risk Profiling:** How do work-life factors (OverTime, DistanceFromHome, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany) interact to predict attrition, and can we identify distinct \"high-risk\" employee profiles?\n\n2.  **Career Stagnation & Compensation Effects:** At what thresholds do career stagnation indicators (YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsInCurrentRole) combined with compensation factors (MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike) become critical predictors of attrition?\n\n3.  **Department-Stratified Satisfaction Analysis:** Does the predictive power of employee satisfaction variables (JobSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction) differ across departments?\n\n**Research Question Justification:**\n\nQuestion 1 was selected because work-life balance represents one of the most modifiable factors under organizational control. Unlike fixed demographics, companies can directly intervene through overtime policies, flexible scheduling, and remote work options.\n\nQuestion 2 addresses career progression and compensation alignment. Organizations frequently lose high-performing employees due to stagnant advancement opportunities. By identifying specific thresholds where promotion delays become critical, HR can implement proactive interventions.\n\nQuestion 3 recognizes that one-size-fits-all retention strategies often fail. Different departments have unique cultures, work demands, and satisfaction drivers. Stratified analysis enables targeted interventions.\n\n## Variable Descriptions\n\n```{r data-overview}\n#| label: data-overview\n\ncat(\"Dataset Dimensions:\", nrow(hr_data), \"employees,\", ncol(hr_data), \"variables\\n\\n\")\n\nvariable_desc <- data.frame(\n  Variable = c(\"Attrition\", \"OverTime\", \"DistanceFromHome\", \"WorkLifeBalance\",\n               \"YearsAtCompany\", \"YearsSinceLastPromotion\", \"YearsInCurrentRole\",\n               \"MonthlyIncome\", \"PercentSalaryHike\", \"JobLevel\",\n               \"JobSatisfaction\", \"EnvironmentSatisfaction\", \"RelationshipSatisfaction\",\n               \"Department\"),\n  Description = c(\"Employee left the company (Yes/No) - Response Variable\",\n                  \"Whether employee works overtime (Yes/No)\",\n                  \"Distance from home to workplace (miles)\",\n                  \"Work-life balance rating (1-4, higher = better)\",\n                  \"Total years at current company\",\n                  \"Years since last promotion\",\n                  \"Years in current role\",\n                  \"Monthly salary (USD)\",\n                  \"Percent salary increase at last review\",\n                  \"Job level within company hierarchy (1-5)\",\n                  \"Job satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Environment satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Relationship satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Department (HR, R&D, Sales)\"),\n  Question = c(\"All\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\")\n)\n\nkable(variable_desc, caption = \"Table 2: Key Variables by Research Question\",\n      col.names = c(\"Variable\", \"Description\", \"Research Q\")) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = \"20%\") %>%\n  column_spec(2, width = \"60%\") %>%\n  column_spec(3, width = \"20%\")\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Data Exploration and Summary Statistics\n\n## Class Imbalance Analysis\n\n```{r class-imbalance}\n#| label: class-imbalance\n#| fig-cap: \"Figure 1: Attrition Distribution - Class Imbalance Analysis\"\n\nattrition_dist <- hr_data %>%\n  count(Attrition) %>%\n  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\nggplot(attrition_dist, aes(x = Attrition, y = n, fill = Attrition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(n, \"\\n(\", round(Percentage, 1), \"%)\")),\n            vjust = -0.3, size = 5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(x = \"Attrition Status\",\n       y = \"Number of Employees\",\n       title = \"Employee Attrition Distribution\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"Class imbalance ratio: \", round(100 - attrition_rate, 1), \"% No vs \", round(attrition_rate, 1), \"% Yes\")) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#6A994E\", \"Yes\" = \"#BC4749\")) +\n  ylim(0, max(attrition_dist$n) * 1.20)\n\nn_total <- nrow(hr_data)\nn_pos <- sum(hr_data$Attrition_Binary)\nn_neg <- n_total - n_pos\nweight_pos <- n_total / (2 * n_pos)\nweight_neg <- n_total / (2 * n_neg)\n\ncat(\"\\n=== Class Imbalance Statistics ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Majority Class (No Attrition):\", n_neg, \"employees (\", round(n_neg/n_total*100, 1), \"%)\\n\")\ncat(\"Minority Class (Attrition):\", n_pos, \"employees (\", round(n_pos/n_total*100, 1), \"%)\\n\")\ncat(\"Imbalance Ratio:\", round(n_neg/n_pos, 2), \":1\\n\\n\")\ncat(\"=== Class Weights for Balanced Learning ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Weight for Class 0 (No Attrition):\", round(weight_neg, 4), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Weight for Class 1 (Attrition):\", round(weight_pos, 4), \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThe dataset exhibits significant class imbalance with `r round(100 - attrition_rate, 1)`% of employees showing no attrition and only `r round(attrition_rate, 1)`% experiencing attrition.

We employ 5-fold CV to tune `mtry`.\n\n3.  **Logistic Regression with Interaction Terms:** Provides interpretable odds ratios with formal statistical inference.

If we reduce overtime workers from 28% to 20% through workload rebalancing and flexible scheduling:\n\n-   **Prevented departures: ~24 employees/year**\n-   **Savings: $1,560,000** (at $65K replacement cost)\n-   **Investment: ~$50,000** (time tracking + temporary contractors)\n-   **ROI: 31:1 in first year**\n\n### Finding 2: Career Stagnation Compounds Exponentially\n\nEach year without promotion increases attrition odds by ~15%, compounding to 77% increase at 4 years. The **4-year mark** represents a critical threshold requiring proactive intervention.\n\n### Finding 3: Satisfaction Effects Vary by Department\n\nR&D shows strong relationships between all satisfaction types and retention; Sales shows selective effects; HR's small sample limits inference.\n\n## Recommendations for HR Practice\n\n1.  **Monitor Overtime:** Implement overtime tracking dashboards and workload rebalancing initiatives. Flag employees exceeding 10+ hours/week overtime for 3+ consecutive months.\n\n2.  **Promotion Cadence:** Establish mandatory career reviews at Year 3. Require documented development plans with timeline commitments.\n\n3.  **Department-Specific Actions:** Deploy different retention strategies by department. Focus on job satisfaction in Sales; comprehensive satisfaction in R&D.\n\n4.  **Risk Scoring System:** Deploy the GBM model for monthly batch scoring. Create tiered intervention protocols based on predicted risk.\n\n## Actionable Next Steps\n\n### Immediate (0-3 months)\n\n1.  **Model Deployment:** Containerize best model for monthly batch scoring\n2.  **Dashboard Creation:** Build Tableau/PowerBI dashboard showing risk distributions\n3.  **Pilot Intervention:** Test overtime reduction with 2-3 high-risk teams\n\n### Short-Term (3-6 months)\n\n1.  **Longitudinal Data Collection:** Implement quarterly satisfaction pulse surveys\n2.  **Model Retraining:** Update models quarterly with new data\n3.  **Expanded Features:** Integrate performance ratings and organizational changes\n\n### Medium-Term (6-12 months)\n\n1.  **Causal Inference:** Apply propensity score matching for causal effect estimation\n2.  **Survival Analysis:** Build Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-attrition\n3.  **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Weight errors by actual replacement costs\n\n### Long-Term (12+ months)\n\n1.  **Prescriptive Analytics:** Move from \"who will leave?\" to \"what intervention for whom?\"\n2.  **NLP Integration:** Analyze exit interview text for early signals\n3.  **Multi-Level Modeling:** Account for team/manager/department hierarchy\n\n## Limitations\n\n1.  **Synthetic Data:** While realistic, the dataset is simulated. Real-world data would require additional preprocessing.\n\n2.  **Class Imbalance:** The 16% attrition rate required careful handling through weighted learning and threshold optimization.\n\n3.  **Missing Departure Reasons:** Distinguishing voluntary resignations from terminations would enable more targeted analysis.\n\n4.  **Cross-Sectional Design:** The snapshot nature allows identification of associations but not causal relationships.\n\n5.  **HR Department Sample Size:** With only n=63, the HR department lacks statistical power for reliable inference.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# References\n\n1.

The study addresses three primary research questions using a multi-method approach including decision trees, cross-validated random forests, logistic regression with interaction terms, LASSO regularization, gradient boosting machines, and stratified departmental analysis.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Work-Life Imbalance:** OverTime emerges as the dominant predictor of attrition across all modeling approaches, with employees working overtime showing approximately 2.9× higher attrition rates (30.5% vs 10.4%). Decision tree analysis identifies distinct high-risk profiles combining overtime work with low tenure.\n\n2.  **Career Stagnation & Compensation:** Years since last promotion demonstrates a compounding effect on attrition risk, with the 4-year mark representing a critical threshold where risk accelerates substantially. LASSO variable selection confirms that career progression indicators outweigh pure compensation metrics.\n\n3.  **Department-Stratified Satisfaction:** The predictive power of satisfaction variables varies significantly across departments. R&D shows strong relationships between all three satisfaction types and retention, while Sales exhibits selective effects, and HR's small sample size limits reliable inference.\n\n```{r executive-summary-table}\n#| label: executive-summary-table\n\nn_employees <- nrow(hr_data)\nattrition_rate <- mean(hr_data$Attrition_Binary) * 100\nn_attrition <- sum(hr_data$Attrition_Binary)\n\novertime_attrition <- hr_data %>%\n  filter(OverTime == \"Yes\") %>%\n  summarise(rate = mean(Attrition_Binary) * 100) %>%\n  pull(rate)\n\nno_overtime_attrition <- hr_data %>%\n  filter(OverTime == \"No\") %>%\n  summarise(rate = mean(Attrition_Binary) * 100) %>%\n  pull(rate)\n\nattrition_table <- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\n    \"Total Employees Analyzed\",\n    \"Overall Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Total Employees Who Left\",\n    \"Overtime Workers Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Non-Overtime Workers Attrition Rate\",\n    \"Relative Risk (Overtime vs Non-Overtime)\"\n  ),\n  Value = c(\n    format(n_employees, big.mark = \",\"),\n    percent(attrition_rate/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    format(n_attrition, big.mark = \",\"),\n    percent(overtime_attrition/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    percent(no_overtime_attrition/100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    paste0(round(overtime_attrition/no_overtime_attrition, 1), \"x\")\n  )\n)\n\nknitr::kable(\n  attrition_table,\n  col.names = c(\"Summary Metric\", \"Value\"),\n  align = c(\"l\", \"c\"),\n  caption = \"Table 1: Executive Summary Statistics\"\n) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Introduction\n\nEmployee turnover represents one of the most significant challenges facing modern organizations. Industry research estimates that replacing an employee costs between 50% and 200% of their annual salary when accounting for recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, training, and lost productivity during the transition period (Society for Human Resource Management, 2022). For a mid-level employee earning $65,000 annually, this translates to replacement costs of $32,500 to $130,000 per departure. Understanding the factors that drive employees to leave enables targeted retention strategies before valuable talent departs.\n\nThis analysis leverages the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, a realistic simulated dataset designed by IBM data scientists specifically for predictive HR analytics research and education. The dataset contains `r nrow(hr_data)` employee records with `r ncol(hr_data)` attributes spanning demographics, job characteristics, satisfaction metrics, and work-life balance indicators.\n\n## Dataset Selection and Justification\n\n**Dataset Source:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset\n**Availability:** Publicly available via data.world repositories (Aizemberg, 2017)\n**Sample Size:** `r format(nrow(hr_data), big.mark = \",\")` employees\n**Variables:** `r ncol(hr_data)` employee attributes\n**Response Variable:** Binary attrition indicator (Yes/No)\n\n**Rationale for Dataset Selection:**\n\nThe selection of this dataset was driven by several methodological and practical considerations that align with the objectives of this statistical learning project:\n\n1.  **Realistic Structure:** While this is a simulated dataset created by IBM data scientists for educational purposes, it accurately mirrors the structure, variable types, and statistical relationships found in actual enterprise HR data. The variables include standard HR metrics (demographics, job characteristics, satisfaction scores, performance ratings) that organizations routinely collect through Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS).\n\n2.  **Appropriate Class Imbalance:** The `r round(attrition_rate, 1)`% attrition rate reflects realistic conditions where employee departure is a minority event, requiring proper handling techniques (weighted learning, threshold optimization, stratified sampling) that generalize to production environments.\n\n3.  **Multiple Variable Types:** The dataset includes categorical variables (Department, JobRole, MaritalStatus), ordinal variables (satisfaction scores 1-4), and continuous variables (Age, MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany), enabling demonstration of diverse modeling techniques.\n\n4.  **No Proprietary Restrictions:** Unlike actual company data which faces confidentiality and privacy restrictions, this dataset can be freely analyzed and published, enabling transparent methodology demonstration.\n\n5.  **Established Benchmark:** This dataset is widely used in HR analytics research and machine learning competitions, providing established baselines for model performance comparison.\n\n**Dataset Limitations Acknowledged:** As a simulated dataset, certain patterns may be artificially clean (no missing values, clear variable definitions). Real-world data would require additional preprocessing. However, the analytical methodologies demonstrated transfer directly to production environments.\n\n## Research Questions\n\nThree primary research questions drove the analysis for this project:\n\n1.  **Work-Life Imbalance & Attrition Risk Profiling:** How do work-life factors (OverTime, DistanceFromHome, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany) interact to predict attrition, and can we identify distinct \"high-risk\" employee profiles?\n\n2.  **Career Stagnation & Compensation Effects:** At what thresholds do career stagnation indicators (YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsInCurrentRole) combined with compensation factors (MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike) become critical predictors of attrition?\n\n3.  **Department-Stratified Satisfaction Analysis:** Does the predictive power of employee satisfaction variables (JobSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction) differ across departments?\n\n**Research Question Justification:**\n\nQuestion 1 was selected because work-life balance represents one of the most modifiable factors under organizational control. Unlike fixed demographics, companies can directly intervene through overtime policies, flexible scheduling, and remote work options.\n\nQuestion 2 addresses career progression and compensation alignment. Organizations frequently lose high-performing employees due to stagnant advancement opportunities. By identifying specific thresholds where promotion delays become critical, HR can implement proactive interventions.\n\nQuestion 3 recognizes that one-size-fits-all retention strategies often fail. Different departments have unique cultures, work demands, and satisfaction drivers. Stratified analysis enables targeted interventions.\n\n## Variable Descriptions\n\n```{r data-overview}\n#| label: data-overview\n\ncat(\"Dataset Dimensions:\", nrow(hr_data), \"employees,\", ncol(hr_data), \"variables\\n\\n\")\n\nvariable_desc <- data.frame(\n  Variable = c(\"Attrition\", \"OverTime\", \"DistanceFromHome\", \"WorkLifeBalance\",\n               \"YearsAtCompany\", \"YearsSinceLastPromotion\", \"YearsInCurrentRole\",\n               \"MonthlyIncome\", \"PercentSalaryHike\", \"JobLevel\",\n               \"JobSatisfaction\", \"EnvironmentSatisfaction\", \"RelationshipSatisfaction\",\n               \"Department\"),\n  Description = c(\"Employee left the company (Yes/No) - Response Variable\",\n                  \"Whether employee works overtime (Yes/No)\",\n                  \"Distance from home to workplace (miles)\",\n                  \"Work-life balance rating (1-4, higher = better)\",\n                  \"Total years at current company\",\n                  \"Years since last promotion\",\n                  \"Years in current role\",\n                  \"Monthly salary (USD)\",\n                  \"Percent salary increase at last review\",\n                  \"Job level within company hierarchy (1-5)\",\n                  \"Job satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Environment satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Relationship satisfaction rating (1-4)\",\n                  \"Department (HR, R&D, Sales)\"),\n  Question = c(\"All\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\", \"Q3\")\n)\n\nkable(variable_desc, caption = \"Table 2: Key Variables by Research Question\",\n      col.names = c(\"Variable\", \"Description\", \"Research Q\")) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = \"20%\") %>%\n  column_spec(2, width = \"60%\") %>%\n  column_spec(3, width = \"20%\")\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Data Exploration and Summary Statistics\n\n## Class Imbalance Analysis\n\n```{r class-imbalance}\n#| label: class-imbalance\n#| fig-cap: \"Figure 1: Attrition Distribution - Class Imbalance Analysis\"\n\nattrition_dist <- hr_data %>%\n  count(Attrition) %>%\n  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\nggplot(attrition_dist, aes(x = Attrition, y = n, fill = Attrition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(n, \"\\n(\", round(Percentage, 1), \"%)\")),\n            vjust = -0.3, size = 5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(x = \"Attrition Status\",\n       y = \"Number of Employees\",\n       title = \"Employee Attrition Distribution\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"Class imbalance ratio: \", round(100 - attrition_rate, 1), \"% No vs \", round(attrition_rate, 1), \"% Yes\")) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#6A994E\", \"Yes\" = \"#BC4749\")) +\n  ylim(0, max(attrition_dist$n) * 1.20)\n\nn_total <- nrow(hr_data)\nn_pos <- sum(hr_data$Attrition_Binary)\nn_neg <- n_total - n_pos\nweight_pos <- n_total / (2 * n_pos)\nweight_neg <- n_total / (2 * n_neg)\n\ncat(\"\\n=== Class Imbalance Statistics ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Majority Class (No Attrition):\", n_neg, \"employees (\", round(n_neg/n_total*100, 1), \"%)\\n\")\ncat(\"Minority Class (Attrition):\", n_pos, \"employees (\", round(n_pos/n_total*100, 1), \"%)\\n\")\ncat(\"Imbalance Ratio:\", round(n_neg/n_pos, 2), \":1\\n\\n\")\ncat(\"=== Class Weights for Balanced Learning ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Weight for Class 0 (No Attrition):\", round(weight_neg, 4), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Weight for Class 1 (Attrition):\", round(weight_pos, 4), \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThe dataset exhibits significant class imbalance with `r round(100 - attrition_rate, 1)`% of employees showing no attrition and only `r round(attrition_rate, 1)`% experiencing attrition.

Unlike Random Forest which builds trees independently in parallel, GBM builds trees sequentially, with each subsequent tree correcting errors made by the previous ensemble.\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n\n1.  **Handles Non-Linearity:** Automatically captures complex interactions\n2.  **Robust to Class Imbalance:** Built-in mechanisms for handling unbalanced outcomes\n3.  **Interpretable Variable Importance:** Rankings based on predictive contribution\n4.  **Industry Standard:** Deployed by leading organizations (Uber, Airbnb, Netflix) for churn prediction\n\n```{r gbm-training}\n#| label: gbm-training\n#| fig-cap: \"Figure 14: Gradient Boosting Machine - Cross-Validation Training\"\n\ngbm_vars <- c(\"OverTime_Binary\", \"YearsAtCompany\", \"YearsSinceLastPromotion\",\n              \"YearsInCurrentRole\", \"MonthlyIncome\", \"PercentSalaryHike\",\n              \"JobLevel\", \"JobSatisfaction\", \"EnvironmentSatisfaction\",\n              \"WorkLifeBalance\", \"StockOptionLevel\", \"DistanceFromHome\",\n              \"Age\", \"TotalWorkingYears\")\n\nset.seed(515)\ngbm_model <- gbm(\n  Attrition_Binary ~ .,\n  data = train_q2[, c(\"Attrition_Binary\", gbm_vars)],\n  distribution = \"bernoulli\",\n  n.trees = 1000,\n  interaction.depth = 4,\n  shrinkage = 0.01,\n  bag.fraction = 0.7,\n  train.fraction = 1.0,\n  n.minobsinnode = 10,\n  cv.folds = 5,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n\nbest_iter <- gbm.perf(gbm_model, method = \"cv\", plot.it = TRUE)\n\ncat(\"\\n=== Gradient Boosting Machine Training Results ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Total trees trained: 1000\\n\")\ncat(\"Optimal trees (5-fold CV):\", best_iter, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Learning rate: 0.01\\n\")\ncat(\"Interaction depth: 4\\n\")\n```\n\n```{r gbm-importance}\n#| label: gbm-importance\n#| fig-cap: \"Figure 15: GBM Variable Importance Rankings\"\n\nimportance_gbm <- summary(gbm_model, n.trees = best_iter, plotit = FALSE)\n\nggplot(importance_gbm[1:min(15, nrow(importance_gbm)), ], \n       aes(x = reorder(var, rel.inf), y = rel.inf)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#6A994E\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Variable\", y = \"Relative Influence (%)\",\n       title = \"Gradient Boosting Variable Importance\",\n       subtitle = paste(\"Based on\", best_iter, \"trees\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14))\n```\n\n```{r gbm-evaluation}\n#| label: gbm-evaluation\n\npred_gbm <- predict(gbm_model, newdata = test_q2, n.trees = best_iter, type = \"response\")\nroc_gbm <- roc(test_q2$Attrition_Binary, pred_gbm, quiet = TRUE)\n\ncat(\"\\n=== GBM Performance on Test Set ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Test Set AUC-ROC:\", round(auc(roc_gbm), 4), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Trees used:\", best_iter, \"\\n\")\n\ncat(\"\\n=== Q2 Model Comparison ===\\n\")\ncat(\"Weighted Logistic Regression: AUC =\", round(auc(roc_q2), 4), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"LASSO Logistic Regression:    AUC =\", round(auc(roc_lasso), 4), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Gradient Boosting Machine:    AUC =\", round(auc(roc_gbm), 4), \"\\n\")\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Research Question 3\n\n## Department-Stratified Satisfaction Analysis {.unnumbered}\n\n*Does the predictive power of employee satisfaction variables differ across departments?*\n\n### Methodology Justification\n\nOne-size-fits-all retention strategies often fail because different departments have unique cultures and satisfaction drivers.

If we reduce overtime workers from 28% to 20% through workload rebalancing and flexible scheduling:\n\n-   **Prevented departures: ~24 employees/year**\n-   **Savings: $1,560,000** (at $65K replacement cost)\n-   **Investment: ~$50,000** (time tracking + temporary contractors)\n-   **ROI: 31:1 in first year**\n\n### Finding 2: Career Stagnation Compounds Exponentially\n\nEach year without promotion increases attrition odds by ~15%, compounding to 77% increase at 4 years. The **4-year mark** represents a critical threshold requiring proactive intervention.\n\n### Finding 3: Satisfaction Effects Vary by Department\n\nR&D shows strong relationships between all satisfaction types and retention; Sales shows selective effects; HR's small sample limits inference.\n\n## Recommendations for HR Practice\n\n1.  **Monitor Overtime:** Implement overtime tracking dashboards and workload rebalancing initiatives. Flag employees exceeding 10+ hours/week overtime for 3+ consecutive months.\n\n2.  **Promotion Cadence:** Establish mandatory career reviews at Year 3. Require documented development plans with timeline commitments.\n\n3.  **Department-Specific Actions:** Deploy different retention strategies by department. Focus on job satisfaction in Sales; comprehensive satisfaction in R&D.\n\n4.  **Risk Scoring System:** Deploy the GBM model for monthly batch scoring. Create tiered intervention protocols based on predicted risk.\n\n## Actionable Next Steps\n\n### Immediate (0-3 months)\n\n1.  **Model Deployment:** Containerize best model for monthly batch scoring\n2.  **Dashboard Creation:** Build Tableau/PowerBI dashboard showing risk distributions\n3.  **Pilot Intervention:** Test overtime reduction with 2-3 high-risk teams\n\n### Short-Term (3-6 months)\n\n1.  **Longitudinal Data Collection:** Implement quarterly satisfaction pulse surveys\n2.  **Model Retraining:** Update models quarterly with new data\n3.  **Expanded Features:** Integrate performance ratings and organizational changes\n\n### Medium-Term (6-12 months)\n\n1.  **Causal Inference:** Apply propensity score matching for causal effect estimation\n2.  **Survival Analysis:** Build Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-attrition\n3.  **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Weight errors by actual replacement costs\n\n### Long-Term (12+ months)\n\n1.  **Prescriptive Analytics:** Move from \"who will leave?\" to \"what intervention for whom?\"\n2.  **NLP Integration:** Analyze exit interview text for early signals\n3.  **Multi-Level Modeling:** Account for team/manager/department hierarchy\n\n## Limitations\n\n1.  **Synthetic Data:** While realistic, the dataset is simulated. Real-world data would require additional preprocessing.\n\n2.  **Class Imbalance:** The 16% attrition rate required careful handling through weighted learning and threshold optimization.\n\n3.  **Missing Departure Reasons:** Distinguishing voluntary resignations from terminations would enable more targeted analysis.\n\n4.  **Cross-Sectional Design:** The snapshot nature allows identification of associations but not causal relationships.\n\n5.  **HR Department Sample Size:** With only n=63, the HR department lacks statistical power for reliable inference.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# References\n\n1.
