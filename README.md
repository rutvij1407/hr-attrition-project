### 2. **Added Research Question Rationale** ✅

Added comprehensive explanation for why each research question was chosen (removed yellow highlight request).

### 3. **Added Multivariate Model Comparison Section** ✅

New comprehensive section comparing all 8 models with decision framework for when to use each model type.
