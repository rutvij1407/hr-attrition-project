## Project Overview

This comprehensive statistical analysis investigates the factors contributing to employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The study addresses three primary research questions:

1.  **Work-Life Imbalance & Attrition Risk Profiling** - Using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression with interactions, and Random Forest

2.  **Career Stagnation Thresholds & Compensation Effects** - Using Weighted Logistic Regression, LASSO variable selection, and ROC-AUC threshold analysis

3.  **Department-Stratified Satisfaction Analysis** - Using stratified logistic regression, VIF analysis, and performance comparison

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset

The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset contains:

-   **1,470** employee records
-   **39** variables including demographics, job characteristics, satisfaction metrics, and work-life balance indicators
-   **16.1%** overall attrition rate (class imbalance)
-   **No missing data**
